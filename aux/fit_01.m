% This is the main script for fitting the experimental data to the model
% from ISODISTORT. Here the initial parameters for the fit can be specified
% (A0, M1, M2, ...). Any of these fit parameters can be fixed in B0, P1,
% P2, ...
% NOTE that the calculate_residual needs to be opened and adjusted
% accordingly where needed (hkl conversion, plotting, ...)
